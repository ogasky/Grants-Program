### Overview

PassMeCash is a decentralized banking system that meet the financial needs of the public through the public using crypto (DOT) & fiat. PassMeCash is a web3 financial solution that will help our target audience access their funds for payment transactions seamlessly and effortlessly through our decentralized agents.
Unlike the traditional centralized banking system where accounts holder funds are kept in bank building and also withdrawn from same bank building; PassMeCash is a community and decentralized financial solution, where the PassMeCash users can request for their funds and it will be available to them for withdrawal via the nearest PassMeCash agent to them. 
PassMeCash is revolutionizing the banking and financial system by bringing funds to its users upon their request, instead of them going to banks to get funds. Users or Businesses can send and receive payments for goods and services via PassMeCash. Cross border payments and transfer can also be done through PassMeCash. Users who need low fiat currency bills to spray celebrants in parties and social functions, can also request for low currency bills through PassMeCash. All transactions on PassMeCash can be done using crypto (DOT) or cash payments.
Thus PassMeCash Products are (i) PassMeCash get cash to its users at their choice of location. (ii) PassMeCash help Users and Businesses send and receive payments. (iii) PassMeCash make available low currency bills to her users upon request. (iv) PassMeCash performs Crypto (DOT) to Cash swap and vise versa, for easy transactions.
and (v) PassMeCash-API for other project development.
The problems addressed by PassMeCash include cash scarcity, low bills requests and crypto to fiat payments, which has affected over 100 million Nigerians in recent time. We intend to build PassMeCash on Polkadot by integrating Python SDK, Node.js with Polkadot.js for generating mnemonics and wallet creation, as regard the funds transactions on PassMeCash. Also, crypto (DOT) will be used for transactions which will lead to more adoption of Polkadot and increase number of DOT holders. Also, we intend to develop a PassMeCash-API that other developers can integrate into projects they are developing. This will aid other Polkadot users to carryout their daily transactions and thus add great value to the entire Polkadot ecosystem.

### Ecosystem Fit

The **PassMeCash** is built for all users of the ecosystem and it can be leveraged upon to send and receive payments globally. Users can also use crypto (DOT) to make transaction payments for goods and services via the PassMeCash platform. Also developers can integrate the PassMeCash-API into their projects, and all these will lead to more adoptability and usability of Polkadot.

## Development Status :open_book:

Details of the development of PassMeCash have been stated above with relevant links and the Developers Team has just been onboarded to develop this project and the team members details can be found via the link https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yo-ELlWX0mJcWOOJKs4xsZ8Uz_oAUXRX0BH1f4y2THk/edit?usp=sharing.


## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

We shall notify the team via the appropriate channel, upon completion of our milestones with a detailed report that will contain relevant links to codes, APIs used, 
relevant Documents and other key information concerning the PassMeCash-Polkadot project. It is also key to note that Polkadot.js will be implemented, as well as the DOT will be used as means of payment transaction which is fully connected to Polkadot. Finally, PassMeCash-API will be built for other developers to integrate into their project development.


### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 10 weeks
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 5
- **Total Costs:** 30,000 USD


### Milestone 1 — Front End Development
- **Estimated duration:** 4 weeks
- **FTE:**  5
- **Costs:** 10,000 USD
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| **0d.** | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | Frontend Development | The front-end would be built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library. This allows for the development of a responsive and user-friendly interface. This will involve the Landing Page & Dashboard, while Tailwind will be used to convert all the Figma files. |



### Milestone 2 — Backend Development, APIs & Libraries

- **Estimated Duration:** 6 weeks
- **FTE:**  5
- **Costs:** 20,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |

| 0e. | Article or Video | We will develop and publish an **article or video** that explains this project in detail for everyone to understand how it works. |
| 1. | Backend Development | The back-end would be built using Django, a python framework. python would handle the wallet's business logic, such as generating and displaying private keys and handling transactions. Integrating Polkadot.js with Node.js, we can generate mnemonics and create wallet address for the blockchain and also encrypt it why passing all necessary details to the user via API created with Django |
| 2. | APIs & Libraries |  Chainlink aggregator would be used to communicate with the Polkadot blockchain nodes and retrieve real time information such as transaction history and account balances. RESTful APIs would be implemented using Django, a python web application framework, and Polkadot.js and Finally, PassMeCash-API will be built for other developers to integrate into their project development. |



## Future Plans

Once this project is completed, we intend to scale it to the next level in the nearest future. Our goal is to maintain and sustain this project.

- We will constantly update our community of users on the platform updates.
- We will provide continuous support for PassMeCash users on a constant and regular basis.
- We will provide continuous support for Developers using the PassMeCash-API in their projects.
