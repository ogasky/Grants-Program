### Overview
This project is to develop Polkadot Wallet for users on the BloodFuse platform (https://bloodfuse.com/) and this will aid the use of DOT for payments
and reimbursements between blood donors, and blood-banks. BloodFuse is a web 3 solution that connects blood donors with blood-banks and hospitals in
need of blood, where crypto and cash are used for transactions.

Over one million units of blood are needed yearly to save lives in Nigeria, but less than one hundred thousand units of blood are supplied and thus, 
the concept of developing a blood donation platform built with web 3 in mind was conceived. To make it secure and innovative, it has to be built using 
web 3.0 technologies, leading to the design of BloodFuse to reduce the scarcity of blood supplies and thus save lives.
BloodFuse is a platform where blood donors are easily connected with blood banks, hospitals or donation centers. BloodFuse is a community of blood donors 
that will be matched with blood recipients based on closeness and proximity.
It is designed to quickly connect blood donors and blood donation centers from anywhere the donor is located with the integration of geo-mapping and transactions
are implemented with a smart contracts between parties. Reimbursement for each completed blood donations are paid either with cash or crypto. Thus there is the need
to develop BloodFuse-PolkaWallet to aid crypto (DOT) transactions on the BloodFuse platform.

Integrating Parachains to BloodFuse will aid the development of appropriate smart-contract for transactions that will happen into the 
**BloodFuse-PolkaWallet**. This will benefit the entire Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape community at large as everyone needs blood to stay alive. 
Thus if there is any challenge or need of blood by the  Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama community members or their loved ones, the BloodFuse platform can be used to 
request for a blood donor to savage the situation. People are in support of the development of BloodFuse, because the result of the research carried out 
during the initial UI/UX design phase of BloodFuse proves it. In addition however, the Nigerian community will benefit greatly from the **BloodFuse-PolkaWallet**
project when completed. We are interested in developing this project because we want to build on Polkadot towards saving lives in Nigeria and beyond. Thank you.


### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

The original documentation can be found via this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P8_wmbL3z1_HaqQs34OmHJPdQanRIHw0 while the initial UI/UX design 
will be find via https://www.figma.com/file/9xw9AXLl9R2mrZVEfOcO0d/BloodFuse-Backup?node-id=0%3A1 and research via 
https://www.figma.com/file/6PxdM8gWzvVhoPlOs1BWm1/BloodFuse-site-map%2Fflow?node-id=0%3A1 and platform is https://bloodfuse.com/
However we are going to modify the UI/UX designs to fi into the **BloodFuse-PolkaWallet** project.

The technology stacks to be used include:
- Figma
- Tailwind
- Javascript
- Python/Django
- Substrate/Parachains


### Ecosystem Fit

The **BloodFuse-PolkaWallet** is built for all users of the ecosystem and it can be leveraged upon to save lives of their loved ones. Users will have this wallet 
as they also can use DOT to make transaction payments or reimbursements on the BloodFuse platform. This will lead to more adoptability and usability of Polkadot.

## Development Status :open_book:

Details of the development of BloodFuse have been stated above with relevant links and we are working towards modifying the UI/UX designs to fit in the modifications
for this project as well as get it developed.


## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 16 weeks
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 3
- **Total Costs:** 30,000 USD
